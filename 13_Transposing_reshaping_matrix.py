""" This section covers arr.reshape(), arr.transpose(), arr.T """

""" 
Itâ€™s common to need to transpose your matrices.
NumPy arrays have the property T that allows you to transpose a matrix.
"""
import numpy as np

""" 
You can also use .transpose() to reverse or 
change the axes of an array according to the values you specify.
